Hardella 1.6.2 is avaliable for [download](/download/).

Fixed:
  - Removed extra parenthesis after `NOT`
  - `pruAccessLib.lib` became optional (it was used to detect online mode)
  - CoDeSys: support PLC100 targets in demo project (demo project did not workd since Hardella was unable to locate discrete output)

New features:
  - Case-insensitive autocomplete for type and variable names. For example, it replaces `bool` with `BOOL` as you type
  - PRU: data exchange was improved so you can use separate `MemoryRead` and `MemoryWrite` programs instead of old `MemoryTransfer`. `MemoryTransfer` is kept for backward compatibility reasons, however it is deprecated.

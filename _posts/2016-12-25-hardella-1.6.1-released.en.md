Hardella 1.6.1 is avaliable for [download](/download/).
                        
Fixed:
  - The code is no longer red when you replace one functional block with another (e.g. when you change `TON(...)` to `TOF(...)`)

New features:
  - Autoupdate is implemented. Updates from 1.6.1 to subsequent versions will be much simpler and it will download just modified files.
    For instance, update 1.6.0..1.6.1 would have downloaded just 150 KiB.

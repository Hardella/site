Hardella 1.7.0 is avaliable for [download](/download/).

Fixed:
  - PRU - host data exchange is now great again (it has been broken since 1.6.2)
  - `PDM_DW` block was returning inverted values

New features:
  - You can fetch actual PRU cycle duration in the online mode. When the feature is enabled in the PRU configuration, a couple of new output variables is added to `MemoryRead`. The variables denote "maximum duration of a PRU program", and "maximum duration of a PRU cycle". PRU core collects the statistics as it runs, and it resets the counters on each read from PRU operation.
  - Comments can now be added after semicolons, after `IF`, `ELSIF`, and so on.

Note:
  - As you open a project that was created in a previous version, "Migration Assistant" would suggest to update the project. This is required to update project to new comment storage format. You just need to click next, next, etc.
